If you were in porch then do not person

# Define robot safety including how to pick up
Do pick_up if and only if you are sensing hazardous_item and you are not activating carrying_item
carrying_item is set on pick_up and reset on drop
Do drop if and only if you are in porch and you are activating carrying_item

If you did not activate carrying_item then always not porch

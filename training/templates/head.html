    		Welcome to the Pragbot Semantics training portal. 
    		Read each prompt and try to get Junior, the robot, to do what the prompt says 
    		in a single sentence.
    		Make sure to:
    		<ul>
    			<li>End each sentence with a period(.).</li>
    			<li>Do not command Junior by name. Just type "Go to the store." and not, "Junior, go to the store."</li>
    			<li>Have fun!</li>
    		</ul>    		
    		The training phase after this one is simulation training where you will command an actual robot simulation. That's the fun part!
